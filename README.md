# Golf Log CRUD application

I created this application to allow the casual golfer, like myself, to help track their progress.
Instead of holding on to wrinkled, dirty scorecards, with this application a user can keep
all their scores in one place.

### Technologies Used:

NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, ejs, Heroku

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the link below and sign up. After logging in all you need to do is click the 'add round' button to get started.

## Whats Next?

I plan on adding some more styling. I want to integrate colors on the scorecard to signify par, birdies, bogeys, etc.
I also want to modify the final score output to show 'even' instead of '0' and to add a '+' in front of positive scores.
